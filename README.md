Part 1.
Paradigm Pet Professionals is a pet consulting company that aims to deliver information to it’s customers via their website and consulting appointments. Their website serves to inform and entice customers to book consultation appointments with them.
The website needs to intuitively display information about basic pet needs and encourage people to book an appointment. The header of each page will have the logo, title, as well as a nav bar to quickly and intuitively navigate to each page. The navbar buttons will change colors when hovered over. The loading icon will be a clip art type paw print with the toes of the print cycling through to show loading. The landing page will have a very brief description of the company as well as eye-catching photos of the different types of pets. There will be a button under each photo. When clicked on, the user will be navigated to a separate page where the more detailed information will be found regarding that pet.  At the bottom of each page, there will be a section that has a brief description of the consultation services and a form to input the necessary information (name, phone number, email address, time zone, pet’s name, type, and age) about the customer so the ‘pexperts’ can reach out to organize a consultation. The header will also contain a special icon that allows users to jump to the section of the page with the form for requesting a consultation. The site will include the separate pages of the pets and their information, an about the company page, a page that includes just the form to request a consultation. When the submit button is clicked for the request form, a success message will display in a text box where the request form was located. 
The content for the dogs will be found on a page dedicated to the information about dogs. It will include the information from “Paradigm Pet Professionals UI Design Specifications” file regarding dogs. The summary of this information will be focused on the activity needs of dogs because that is what users are generally interested in. It will include the remaining pictures and some helpful information, yet I will be sure to refrain from giving too much information for free because the point of the website is to get people to book consultations.
User Persona: DOG OWNERS are interested in the activity needs of their puppy throughout its lifetime. They are often viewing the website from a handheld device as they are working with their puppy. They want to understand how play can support the dog’s health and are interested in recommendations about pet toys that encourage physical activity.
There are some parts of the website that I would redevelop. I would summarize the information given to be more of an informational teaser and incorporate more “contact us” forms to really push and encourage visitors to book a consultation session. I will revamp the general design of the website. I will also remove the FAQ section. I find that section outdated and not very helpful. I also think I will leave out the search bar. There is not enough information on the website to need the search bar and I believe that the site will be intuitively navigable enough to not need it.

The information architecture is easy to navigate. Each page on the site can be easily navigated to using the buttons on the home page or the buttons in the standardized nav bar found on each and every page. Each page then also has a contact section as well as a way to navigate to the contact page encouraging booking a consultation session as much as possible. 
The primary navigation element is the standardized navbar found on every page. This makes every page easy to reach from every other page. The secondary navigation elements are the buttons found on the home page that navigate to each informational page. There are additional navigational buttons located in the footer of each page that navigate to each informational page and the contact form. The information is easily accessible for the users and the consultations are pushed (which is in the stakeholder’s best interest).
